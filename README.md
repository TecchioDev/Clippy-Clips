# Clippy-Clips
A little tool that saves your cliboard history. If you guys like it, i can make a better version with more customization

# Quick Setup
To download this productivity tool, you must use **Linux debian** distribuitions. All you have to do is 

# How to use?
Here's a quick guide on how it works:
## Icon tray
You can always open the clips' history through clippy: the clip icon that stays in your upper bar (at the side of the time, you know where i'm talking about, dont'cha?)
## Tool
It's easy! Once you open the app, let it there in your tray. When you copy items, they all go automatically in your history. Who knows when you need them back? Just know that you have a 20 clips limit to not fry your computer. Who would need more than 20 anyway?
## Functions
By now, you can clear your history and save any lenght of words, included tabbed and multiline texts of course! Welp, it's the first version, don't expect much! Maybe I can update it...?

# Good to go!
Simple as that! Now you can either download the file already or watch this short video on how does it work on Ubuntu. Have fun!
